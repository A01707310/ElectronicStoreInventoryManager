# InventarioAlmacenElectronica
This project is an implementation of a simple **Electronics Store Inventory Manager.** The project aims to provide a tool that performs many operations such as setting and changing the price, existancy, brand/model, among other details for many electronics, which are also meant to be added/deleted trough this program. 

## Context
Having a **complete control over the inventory** is a **primordial** task that anyone who has to **manage an electronics store** should consider before nothing. Nowadays, software brings us solutions that make this tasks much **easier** while increasing **productivity**, Object Oriented Programming as a concept brings us an interesting proposal that will help during the landing of this project: with its classes, OOP paves us the way to store as many different types of electronics without writtting that much of code while doing a versatile job.

## Why is it interesting?
This is interesting from the coding side because it enhaces the developer's comprehension on the extense amount of concepts involved in OOP. From an electronics store inventory manager, this eases the for it way to achieve a nice control over what's happening inside its business and also for it to planify informedly.
